Class 5 notes:

doesn't seem like an accurate description. "a String object is internally implemented as an array of chars"

A String object is



Is it accurate to state that Java string objects are intrinsically a class defined as an immutable array of chars?
No. A Java String object is (currently - it's an implementation detail which I gather may be changing) a class containing a few fields:

A char[] containing the actual characters
A starting index into the array
A length
A cached hash code, lazily computed

overloaded method -- two methods with the same name, where they each accept a different number of arguments an example of polyphorphism

csv comma separated values

the reference may be different when two variables point to the same object
the reference is translated by the jvm? to find the correct object

are any other packages included with the current version of JVM that we installed on our computer
ternary (some latin way of saying three) - condition ? value : value -- there are 3 parts
