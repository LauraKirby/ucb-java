// 1. Does a superclass have access to the members of a subclass? Does a subclass have access to the members of a superclass?
//
// 2. Create a subclass of TwoDShape called Circle.
// Include an area( ) method that computes the area of the circle and a constructor that uses super to initialize the TwoDShape portion.
//
// 3. How do you prevent a subclass from having access to a member of a superclass?
//
// 4. Describe the purpose and use of both versions of super.
//
// 5. Given the following hierarchy:
//    class Alpha { ... class Beta extends Alpha { ... Class Gamma extends Beta { ...In
//     what order are the constructors for these classes called when a Gamma object is instantiated?
//
// 6. A superclass reference can refer to a subclass object. Explain why this is important as it relates to method overriding.
//
// 7. What is an abstract class?
//
// 8. How do you prevent a method from being overridden? How do you prevent a class from being inherited?
//
// 9. Explain how inheritance, method overriding, and abstract classes are used to support polymorphism.
//
// 10. What class is a superclass of every other class?
//
// 11. A class that contains at least one abstract method must, itself, be declared abstract. True or False?
//
// 12. What keyword is used to create a named constant?
