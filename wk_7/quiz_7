Quiz 7
1. Can a subclass "hide" the superclass version
of a method with the same name?
--> yes

2. Class B extends
A. Both have a method called makeApplesauce.
In B, this method takes a boolean argument.
In A, this method takes a String argument. Is
the method overloaded, overridden, both, or neither?
--> overloaded

3. True or false: Just as a ruling of
the federal Supreme Court overrides
a ruling of the California Supreme Court,
so a superclass method named doSomething()
overrides the subclass method named doSomething().
--> false

4. True or false: The return type is not
relevant in method overloading
--> false

5. True or false: The return type is
not relevant in method overriding.
--> true

6. Suppose class B extends class A,
and class A has a static SPEED_LIMIT
field set to  65. When I explicitly call the
constructor of class B, what is implicitly called
such that the subclass field, B.SPEED_LIMIT,
is automatically initialized to 65?
--> the superclass constructor

7. Is Question 6 about
encapsulation, polymorphism, or inheritance?
--> inheritance

8. Question 6 is an illustration of a concept
called the __o_______ of derivation.
--> order

9. True or false: Just as we want not only the leaders, but each ordinary
person, to have common sense, the common logic among a hierarchy of classes
must be defined explicitly in each subclass.
--> false

10. At http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html
, the class declaration says public final
class String. What could we do with the behavior of
the length() method of this class if the class were
not declared to be final?
---> we could subclass the class and override the methods

11. What does the word final mean for
these three levels?:
a) a final class cannot be ________
--> extended or subclasses
b) a final method cannot be ________
--> overridden
c) a final variable cannot be ________
--> reassigned

12. no, abstract can be mixed
13. super.calculate(22.2)
14. a constructor
20. yes
21. No
22 yes
23 false
24 yes
25 -->true  -->true
26 true
