1. What is the difference between an Exception and an Error?
- Error related to errors that occur in the JVM
- Exception in the source code

2. True or False: A senior programmer is someone who is able write code to handle the typical errors that the application might encounter.
- False, should write code for exception

3. True or false: An exception object is an instance of a class.
- True

4. What is the default exception handling mechanism?
  a. print error message
  b. prints the stack trace
  c. stop running, program terminate


5. What is the benefit of writing code to deal with exceptions?
  a. For the end-user?: so that the program doesn't just crash
  b. For the software developer or "white box" tester?: so that the test has more information on what caused the execption
  c. For the software architect?: so that they can group certain exceptions together, to instruct software developers from

6. What causes the ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception?
  a. index is attemped to be used that is higher or lower than the index within the array


7. Is Throwable a class or an interface? What is the advantage of having it be a [class or interface] rather than a [class or interface]?
  a. class
  b. advantage: there are different constructors for throwable, you won't have to write an implemenation for each method

8. If you try to divide an int by zero, will you get an Error or an Exception, and what is its name?
  a. Exception
  b. ArithmeticException

9. If you divide a double by zero, what is the result?
  a. infinity

10. Can the compiler detect the problem of the class with main being in a file with a non-matching file name, such as class HelloWorld being in Helloworld.java?
  a. no

11. Can the code in a catch block at runtime fix the problem of the class with main being in a file with a non-matching file name, such as class HelloWorld being in Helloworld.java?
a. no

12. Should this problem above be an Error or an Exception?
a. it's an Error becuase you cannot fix it at runtime

13. Assuming your program has one try block and one catch block, what makes execution skip over:
  the catch block? if 0 occurs
  part of the try block? if an exception occurs

14. Why might you create a custom exception?
  a. allows the program to react or handle any special conditions

15. Can you use the keyword throw to force the JVM to rethrow an exception that has already been caught?
  a. yes

16. When do you use the keyword throws?
  a. to tell the compiler that you do not have a catch block for that type of exception, only necessary for checked exceptions, which are not part of Runtime Exceptions

17. (Fill in the blanks) A (a) final block is commonly used to allow the JVM's garbage collector to "cleanup" resource-intensive objects created in the corresponding try block. One example is a (b) database connection, which has a close method - http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/Connection.html#close%28%29. Another example would be to close the memory buffer of a stream, by calling  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/BufferedInputStream.html#close%28%29.

18. Does the finally code block execute if there is:
  a. a catch block that matches the exception that has been thrown?
    - yes
  b. no catch block that matches the exception that has been thrown?
    - yes

19. True or False: If a method is defined to return a value and that method has a finally block, immediately after the method returns the value to the caller, but before the caller can run its code, the finally block is automatically executed.
  - False

20. True or False: The compiler allows you to have try and finally without any catch. - True

21. If there are multiple catch blocks, must each be for a different exception type? - Yes


22. We saw how inheritance is enforced by a subclass implicitly calling the constructor of its superclass. Should we write our code so that the superclass version of the exception is caught first?
- no, "unreachable code"

23. Which operator allows a catch block to catch more than one type of exception? Hint: See FinallyAlwaysExecutesWithASingleCatch.java
- | or  (pipe)

24. What would be a use case for having one catch block catch more than one type of exception?
- convenient, DRY

25. (Fill in the blanks) The majority of exceptions are objects of a __s_______________ of java.lang.R______________.
a. subclass
b. java.lang.RunTimeErrors

26. True or False: The length of an array must be 1 or greater.
a. False

27. Which of the following are true about an application that allows its end-users to see a stack trace?
  a. Stack trace information can enable end-users to give Support helpful diagnostic information. - True
  b. Stack trace information can confuse an end-user who has not taken First Course in Java at U.C. Berkeley Extension. - True
  c. Stack trace information can enable a malicious hacker to get information that might useful to launch an attack. - True
