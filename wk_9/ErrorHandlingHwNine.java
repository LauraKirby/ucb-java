  Application description::
    1.  Write a program with exception handling that uses:
        a) try,
        b) catch, and
        c) finally.

    2. The program must catch:
      a) a standard exception provided at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/
      b) a custom exception that you invent

  Additional notes:
    - Instead of writing an entirely new program, it is acceptable to add exception handling to one of your earlier programs.
    - Follow the Java convention of naming your Exception class with suffix Exception.
    - For example, OddNumberException or AttemptLimitExceededException.
