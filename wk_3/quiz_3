Quiz 3
1.  Which type of loop is guaranteed to run at least once?
  a. do while

2.  An if statement must present a test that evaluates to which data type?
  a. boolean

3.  What statement can you add after if and else if to handle any conditions they do not handle?
  a. else

4.  True or false: In Java, the logic of an "if, else if, else" ladder is different from that of a switch because a switch needs the keyword "break" to avoid one case falling through to the next case, but with "if, else if, else" the evaluations are 100% separate.
  a. true

5.  True or false:
  (a) A case in a switch expression can check for a floating-point value.
    - False
  (a) A case in a switch expression can check for a String value.
    - True, as of JDK 7

6.  The following
  for(;;) { }
  is called an ________ loop. Writing it this way, it is clearly intentional, not a bug. Name two common use cases for such a loop?
  (a) infinite
  (b) keeping a computer on, terminal input

7.  Rewrite the following as a for loop:
  int i = 0;
  while(i < 5)
  { System.out.println(i);
  i++;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
  {
    System.out.println(i);
  }

8.  The keyword _________ causes a loop to immediately terminate its current iteration and exit completely from the loop, without evaluating the possibility of re-iteration.
  - break

9.  The keyword _________ causes a loop to immediately terminate its current iteration to evaluate whether it can reenter the loop's next iteration.
  - continue

10. If the awaited condition of a switch does not occur, execution goes to the optional  __________ statement.
  - default

11. If you write a switch in which two cases test for the same constant value, will you get a runtime error or a compiler error?
  - complier

12. Fill in the blank:
  - break

13. Fill in the blank:
  - else

14. A for loop contains three expressions in the following order: (a) initialization of the counter, (b) condition to test, and (c) increment the counter.
  (a) What is the order of these three expressions in a while loop?
    a. initialization, b. test, c. increment

  (b) What is the order of these three expressions in a do while loop?
  a. a c b

15. Does Java have a way to generate a number that appears to be a random number? If so, what is it?
  -
  - java.util.Random.nextInt()
16. Write the code that returns the first letter of a String as a char.
  - charAt(0)

17. Write the code that converts an uppercase String to a lowercase String.
  - String inputLK = "HELLO"
    inputLK.toLowerCase()
    inputLK.toUpperCase()

20. What is System.in?
  - user input from the console

21. What is System.out?
  - items printed to the console

22. In the most common form of a standard for loop, the counter value is changed:
  • As soon as the condition test evaluates to true.
  • Just before testing the condition.
  --> • As soon as the last line of code in the loop block has finished execution.
