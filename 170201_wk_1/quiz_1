embeded os - fastest
c - second fastest

static, exists and is accessible before an actual object is created, only one copy. special place (and only stored in one place for efficiency) for static data
other class methods are not accessible before instantiating an instance

fields --> similar to property --> represent data
constructor ---> how i initialize an instance of the class
method ---> behavior of that instance
